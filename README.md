💼 Experience & Expertise

I used to be a programmer who wrote Java, and after writing about a year later, I switched to 
the go track, I like the introductory block shortness of the go language, I am always curious 
about new things, I am already a go language developer in front of me, and I look forward to 
a more brilliant performance of go in the future.


📚 Study & Research

A bulk programmer who likes the surprise of creating programs and getting results, is accustomed 
to simple and efficient things, and looks forward to making progress in programming. In the future, 
I will always be on the go track, and I will learn some front-end knowledge such as javascript, 
vue, etc. in my spare time, and I will study Rust if I have energy.

I'll update my github gradually.
